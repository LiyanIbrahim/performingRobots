# September21 Hot Glue Gun Assignment 
<p> 
  I decided to make a supplies holder using cardboard and the hot glue gun. I then used it to store my pens, pencils, scissors and smaller cardboard scrapes that I want to save to use later.

## Process:
1. Measuring and cutting
2. Glueing 

Figuring out the order of glueing of the different pieces and adjusting the measurements based on that so they fit nicely 
3. I then let it dry and used coloured sharpies to decorate it 

## Final Result:
