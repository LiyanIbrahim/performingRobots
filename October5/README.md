## Concept: 
For this assignment, I wanted to create a simple version of a robot or machine that could be used to deliver hand sanitizer to a group of people (of only 3 of course). 

## How it works: 
It starts off by going forward, towards the people. It then turns using a certain angle multiple times in order to be facing these different people. It does this pattern once and while it’s going, it plays a sound called “dying robot”. Then if the button is pressed, it will play a happy song and does the same pattern again. If not, it will just stop.  

## Pictures of robot:

## Notes: 
I used a software called Audacity in order to make the sound “dying robot” which I got online repeat a certain amount of times I wanted it to. </br>
I wanted to avoid hot glueing as many components as I could. So I made a box at the back of the robot to insert the battery and speaker. I don’t think this was a good idea since it caused an imbalance in my robot and it now needs to be tilted in order to move.  </br>
Also, Dying Robot is mp3.playTrack(3) and party is mp3.playTrack(1)
