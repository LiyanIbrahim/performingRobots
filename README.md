### Concept description:
For this production assignment, I wanted to generate two different patterns for the two switches, in which both of the switches will be controlling all the 5 LEDs connected to the Arduino. <br /> 
**For switch 1 (Purple wire):**  <br />
I wanted to reflect a light pattern which will keep iterating until termination which will have a different pattern. The pattern produced by this switch was a simplified, restricted version of a (potentially) functional system which will always have a certain LED pattern going but depending on some external factor, will change the pattern.  <br />
**For switch 2 (Yellow wire):**  <br />
I wanted to recreate the first tune in the song Jingle Bells as played on the piano. This concept came from the idea of creating the illusion of listening to this song through the light pattern. I chose Jingle Bells because it was a common song and therefore, easier for the viewer to correlate the tune to the LED pattern and also because I was using 5 LEDs and the tune shown also uses 5 keynotes on the piano. Therefore, each LED corresponds to one keynote on the piano.<br />
