## Concept:
For this assignment, I wanted to expand and make this an extension of my previous project. My previous robot was a simple robot that just delivers hand sanitizer. The movements involved addresses different people by having the robot move at an angle at about one pivot. For this robot, it’s communicating to the people it's serving that it's a good, useful service robot despite what the media has been perpetuating. However, it is also used to show the “emotions” attributed to a robot are presented in an extreme manner. This is shown through the OLED which is either showing hearts and good patterns or “destruction”. The movement of the motor is also meant to match that. 

## Demo: 
I did not anticipate how hard it would be to film the entire performance in one shot since I had many different angles so I filmed multiple shots and edited them together. </br>

[This is my best attempt to film a none edited version](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AhQIDHK_zRVfDvMZg_CICTx3n-73YtCq) </br>


## Some notes about this assignment: 
<ul>
  <li> I wanted my robot to not represent a human. Therefore, most of my emotions or expressions were communicated as words since I did not want to associate expressions to facial expressions. The other shapes I used are ones that I associated with certain emotions but I do think that is very subjective and depending on the person and it would be interesting to explore different, more objective, ways of communicating expressions through non-anthropomorphic ideas. </li>
  <li> For some reason, my OLED was failed to allocate everytime I declared global variables of type String. I tried to change the order they appeared in but I was still facing the same issue. I ended up getting rid of them and hardcoding the different functions that print the different strings. </li>
  <li> I also don't know why, but when filming the performance, the OLED display glitches but it did not glitch when in real life. </li>
  </ul>
