## Play and Scene for this assignment: 
For this assignment, my initial idea is to have my robot act in this [scene](http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/romeo_4_3.html) in the play Romeo and Juliet. This is the scene between Juliet and her nurse and it takes place in Juliet’s chamber. 

## Ideas and Plan: 
<ul>
  <li>I want my robot to play Juliet since she has more lines in this scene and therefore, I need to record these lines and use a voice editing software to adjust my voice and add some background music or sound effects if any. </li>
 
<li> From that first idea, I am still thinking about what role my robot plays. Do I want it to be Juliet herself or do I want to get a doll and place her in the robot? This second way allows the robot to facilitate the idea of action, voice and other characteristics otherwise not there by just a doll. However, I do think it would be more exciting to use the robot as the actor herself and explore different ways of presenting the actor completely as a robot. </li>
</ul>

## Ideas I’ve tried: 
I tried placing the doll in the pouch that was already in my robot but it was not too exciting and so from my previous point, I think I would like to explore having the act be exclusively the robot.

## Ideas for scenery and props: 

Since my parents live nearby and I have a younger sister, I plan on borrowing dolls and doll props to play the other actors and decorate the stage. </br> 
Since my scene takes place in Juliet’s chamber, I would ideally like to recreate that environment using doll props such as a bed, couch, some sort of curtains, some indication of a window and other props relevant to the scene. </br>
One problem I might encounter is the relative size of the robot compared to the barbie and the other props (which many of them are made for the size of the barbie).
