## Play and Scene for this assignment: 
For this assignment, my initial idea is to have my robot act in this scene (put link) in the play Romeo and Juliet. This is the scene between Juliet and her nurse and it takes place in Juliet’s chamber. 

## Ideas and Plan: 
<ul>
  <li>I want my robot to play Juliet since she has more lines in this scene and therefore, I need to record these lines and use a voice editing software to adjust my voice and add some background music or sound effects if any. </li>
 
<li> From that first idea, I am still thinking about what role my robot plays. Do I want it to be Juliet herself or do I want to get a doll and place her in the robot? This second way allows the robot to facilitate the idea of action, voice and other characteristics otherwise not there by just a doll. However, I do think it would be more exciting to use the robot as the actor herself and explore different ways of presenting the actor completely as a robot. </li>
</ul>

## Ideas I’ve tried: 
I tried placing the doll in the pouch that was already in my robot but it was not too exciting and so from my previous point, I think I would like to explore having the act be exclusively the robot.
