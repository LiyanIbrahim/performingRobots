## Play and Scene for this assignment: 
For this assignment, my idea is to have my robot act in this [scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyF2JWZ-OAc) in the play As you like it. This is the scene between Orlando and Rosalind and it takes place in a forest. 

## Ideas and Plan: 
<ul>
  <li>I want my robot to play Rosalind since she has more lines in this scene and her lines are more exciting and therefore, I need to record these lines and use a voice editing software to adjust my voice (or the videos) and add some background music or sound effects if any. </li>
 
<li> From that first idea, I am still thinking about what role my robot plays. Do I want it to be Rosalind herself or do I want to get a doll and place her in the robot? This second way allows the robot to facilitate the idea of action, voice and other characteristics otherwise not there by just a doll. However, I do think it would be more exciting to use the robot as the actor herself and explore different ways of presenting the actor completely as a robot. </li>
</ul>

## Ideas I’ve tried: 
I tried placing the doll in the pouch that was already in my robot but it was not too exciting and so from my previous point, I think I would like to explore having the act be exclusively the robot.

## Ideas for scenery and props: 

Since my parents live nearby and I have a younger sister, I plan on borrowing dolls and doll props to play the other actors and decorate the stage. </br> 
Since my scene takes place in a. forest, I would ideally like to recreate that environment using fake plants, wood, cardbord and other props relevant to the scene. </br>
One problem I might encounter is the relative size of the robot compared to the barbie and the other props (which many of them are made for the size of the barbie).

##  Deciding how to use the OLED: 

For my purposes, I do want to use the OLED but not in a traditional manner. While my robot does look like a human, I do not think the scene I used will need the OLED as a “facial expression” generator. For now, I think it would be cool to display different aspects of the character’s personality and the dynamic of the scene.
Some examples include: </br>
<ul>
  <li>“Rosalind falls in love with Orlando at first sight”</li>
  <li>“Rosalind is a particular favorite among feminist critics, who admire her ability to subvert the limitations that society imposes on her as a woman.”</li>
  <li> "She has, indeed, been frequently regarded as the ideal romantic heroine — very warm and very human, and in any good production, she dominates the stage."(Which is very funny because she literally is not human in my play)
  </ul>
  
Everything I have written so far was all done pre October 24. [This](https://github.com/LiyanIbrahim/performingRobots/blob/master/robotShakespeare/shakespeareT1.ino) is the program that I've written pre October 24, and [this](https://github.com/LiyanIbrahim/performingRobots/blob/master/robotShakespeare/ScriptDrafts.md) is the script I've written pre October 24 based on everything described. 

## October 24: 
Today, I have to evaluate what I have done so far and test the program to make sure the robot is doing what I want. Then I need to record the audio, set up the scene and film it! 

I think the best way to test it is to test scene by scene and combining the scenes that I am happy with.

**Check in 1**: 

After fixing up the code and making sure the robot runs smoothly according to the code, I had to record the sounds and dialogue for the play. 
After doing that and inserting them in the SD card, I realized that my SD card was not reading them correctly even though I labelled them and was indexing them correctly. After many many tries and many many serial print statements, I resorted to combining the different mp3 files into one and having muted slots between them where Orlando speaks. 

Also, even though we were advised not to have the robot move and speak at the same time, my scene was underwhelming in the sense that it was more of a conversation and not an acting scene. Therefore, most of the play has the robot speaking without movement but some parts still had them both since they provoked more emotions in my opinion.
