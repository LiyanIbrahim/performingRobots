## Week 1: 
After looking through many many songs, although many of them are descriptive, I wanted to create an emotional performance through my robot and none of the songs I looked into facilitiated that for me. Therefore, I decided to start looking into poems. I also started looking into Arabic Poets and poems. From that, I identified a poet that I liked and I wanted to explore his different poems to eventually pick one that can allow me to produce an emotional yet visual performance. 

For now, I decided to go with the poem "A Lesson In Drawing" 

What this poem discusses? </br>
The poems’ general theme is the feeling of being “stateless” and not being able to call a place home. Which I think is very fitting for a robotic performance since what really composes a robots “nationality” or “home”? 

Outline of the story:

The story would follow the lyrics in the poem in which there are two characters, the son and the father. The son prompts his dad to draw different things throughout the scene and his dad’s reactions are emotional and very powerful. His “reaction” encompasses multiple different things such as what he draws(action), what he says(verbal reaction) and his facial expressions. This interaction between the son and the father will form the basis of my performance.

My robot: 

I want my robot to play the father since he’s the main character and feels and remembers these emotions and acts based on it. I’m very conflicted on how I want to represent this character. I’m leaning towards having it shaped like a human but doesn't have human features. I want it to have all the aspects and emotions visibly on the robot instead of human features. 

My scene: 
I want to have my scene take place in a relatively dim setting and have the light come from within the robot. If my robot is intricately designed, then I would want to balance it with a more "simple set". I want some emotions to be portrayed through visuals and so I am open to have that integrated through the robot itself or the scene.
