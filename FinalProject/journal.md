## Week 1: 
After looking through many many songs, although many of them are descriptive, I wanted to create an emotional performance through my robot and none of the songs I looked into facilitiated that for me. Therefore, I decided to start looking into poems. I also started looking into Arabic Poets and poems. From that, I identified a poet that I liked and I wanted to explore his different poems to eventually pick one that can allow me to produce an emotional yet visual performance. 

For now, I decided to go with the poem "A Lesson In Drawing"
