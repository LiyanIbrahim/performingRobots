## Week 1: 


After looking through many many songs, although many of them are descriptive, I wanted to create an emotional performance through my robot and none of the songs I looked into facilitiated that for me. Therefore, I decided to start looking into poems. I also started looking into Arabic Poets and poems. From that, I identified a poet that I liked and I wanted to explore his different poems to eventually pick one that can allow me to produce an emotional yet visual performance. 

For now, I decided to go with the poem "A Lesson In Drawing" 

**What this poem discusses?** 

The poems’ general theme is the feeling of being “stateless” and not being able to call a place home, it discusses the effects of war through a conversation between a son and a father, Which I think is very fitting for a robotic performance since what really composes a robots “nationality” or “home”? In this poem, the father narrates and outlines the story from his eyes and point of view and therefore, already creating this set and scene in the reader's mind.

**Why this poem?**
I chose this poem because I think it already induces an emotional response in the reader by just reading the poem. It is phrased in a way of a story with dialogue embedded in the poem itself. It also has some emotions (like what the dad felt when asked these questions) clearly stated yet still open for interpretation. Also, while I do think that the poet is narrating a very specific story, I think the outline and emotions discussed could be applicable and appeal to a wide range of audience even if they haven't been in the same situation being described. </br>
While my main goal is to have the audience think about their own personal experience (in relation to events and people in their everyday life or those they are familiar with), I also think it is to a certain degree meta since I’m using a robot actor and robots (as described above) do not really belong and identify and so while it’s not necessarily explicit, it could add to the conversation about robot belonging and how we treat them and where they belong. 

**Outline of the story:**

The story would follow the lyrics in the poem in which there are two characters, the son and the father. The son prompts his dad to draw different things throughout the scene and his dad’s reactions are emotional and very powerful. His “reaction” encompasses multiple different things such as what he draws(action), what he says(verbal reaction) and his facial expressions. This interaction between the son and the father will form the basis of my performance.

**Outline of my Performance:**
From the outline of my story, I want my performance to be split into different scenes. In the poem, the son asks his father to draw multiple things and this is how I will split the scene. Each scene will cover the interaction for the son asking to draw one thing.  

**My robot:** 

I want my robot to play the father since he’s the main character and feels and remembers these emotions and acts based on it. I’m very conflicted on how I want to represent this character. I’m leaning towards having it shaped like a human but doesn't have human features. I want it to have all the aspects and emotions visibly on the robot instead of human features. 
My robot will also be (obviously) a 3D shape but the number of faces or sides will depend on the number of scenes. For each scene, the robot will face one way revealing one face (and this face will be decorating in a way that corresponds with whatever is being discussed in the theme). The specific ideas for each face will be under the costume section.

**My scene:** 
I want to have my scene take place in a relatively dim setting and have the light come from within the robot. If my robot is intricately designed, then I would want to balance it with a more "simple set". I want some emotions to be portrayed through visuals and so I am open to have that integrated through the robot itself or the scene.
