# Welcome to My Final Project! 
## A Lesson In Drawing - Nizar Qabbani, Performance using a Robot 


**Concept:** 
For my final performance, I decided to have my robot be the main actor for the performance of Nizar Qabbani’s “A Lesson In Drawing” poem. The poems’ general theme is the feeling of being “stateless” and mourning war; it discusses the effects of war through a conversation between a son and a father.

**Why this poem:** 
I chose this poem because I think it already induces an emotional response in the reader by just reading the poem. It is phrased in a way of a story with dialogue embedded in the poem itself. It also has some emotions (like what the dad felt when asked these questions) clearly stated yet still open for interpretation. Also, while I do think that the poet is narrating a very specific story, I think the outline and emotions discussed could be applicable and appeal to a wide range of audience even if they haven't been in the same situation being described. Therefore, I have a wide range of emotions and factors to stimulate these emotions when performing the poem. 

**Why use robots: **
I thought this poem was suitable for a robotic performance because of 2 main reasons: 
There has been multiple discussions about the poem being too political while the poet did not necessarily intend that. I think using robots strips down the specific political connotations and prompts the viewers to think about the verses in the poem more flexibly and on a larger scale. For example, it could be perceived from one's own personal experience or from the robotic experience as described in point #2. 
While we had many many fruitful discussions on the implications of integrating robots into society from all the different perspectives of the involved parties, I think this performance and poem perfectly carries on these conversations by prompting the user to think about what belonging, homeland, fatherhood and the different qualities described in the poem means to robots of if they mean anything and at what point would these things mean to us in relation to the robot (thinking about purely robotic environments and interrelationships and integration). 

**Construction:**
While my full adventure with constructing the robot could be found in my journey, I wanted to quickly explain how it’s relevant and how it ended up looking like in my performance.
