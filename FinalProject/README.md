# Welcome to My Final Project! 
## A Lesson In Drawing - Nizar Qabbani, Performance using a Robot 


**Concept:** 

For my final performance, I decided to have my robot be the main actor for the performance of [Nizar Qabbani’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizar_Qabbani) “[A Lesson In Drawing](https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/a-lesson-in-drawing-2/)” poem. The poems’ general theme is the feeling of being “stateless” and mourning war; it discusses the effects of war through a conversation between a son and a father.

**Why this poem:** 

I chose this poem because I think it already induces an emotional response in the reader by just reading the poem. It is phrased in a way of a story with dialogue embedded in the poem itself. It also has some emotions (like what the dad felt when asked these questions) clearly stated yet still open for interpretation. Also, while I do think that the poet is narrating a very specific story, I think the outline and emotions discussed could be applicable and appeal to a wide range of audience even if they haven't been in the same situation being described. Therefore, I have a wide range of emotions and factors to stimulate these emotions when performing the poem. 

**Why use robots:**

I thought this poem was suitable for a robotic performance because of 2 main reasons: 
There has been multiple discussions about the poem being too political while the poet did not necessarily intend that. I think using robots strips down the specific political connotations and prompts the viewers to think about the verses in the poem more flexibly and on a larger scale. For example, it could be perceived from one's own personal experience or from the robotic experience as described in point #2. 
While we had many many fruitful discussions on the implications of integrating robots into society from all the different perspectives of the involved parties, I think this performance and poem perfectly carries on these conversations by prompting the user to think about what belonging, homeland, fatherhood and the different qualities described in the poem means to robots of if they mean anything and at what point would these things mean to us in relation to the robot (thinking about purely robotic environments and interrelationships and integration). 

**Construction:**

While my full adventure with constructing the robot could be found in my journey, I wanted to quickly explain how it’s relevant and how it ended up looking like in my performance.

My different faces, used for different scenes, not on robot:

**Notes about the video:**

In this section of my documentation, I’d like to discuss my decisions behind the set, scenes and some actions my robot took. But of course, with that being said, the premise of my performance is to have the poem be open to interpretation from the viewer but these are just some of my intentions behind having the robot in a certain way. </br> 
Robot costuming:</br> 
<li> Costume 1: The first scene talks about a bird and the fathers reaction to being asked to draw a bird.  When I think of birds,I think of happy joyful memories and therefore, colors and so the robot has a lot of colors at the top but since the dad’s reaction is not so positive, the colors fade to black. This highlights the complexity in the fathers character between his memories and his current life.</li> 

<li> Costume 2: This is the only costume in which the father looks like a human. However, instead of the face, I decided to use the OLED display to display the phrase “Memory failed” to indicate how the father doesn’t remember how to draw the sea. I decided to display that phrase on an OLED since it also adds a mechanical nature to it. </li> 

<li> Costume 3: This one is heavily inspired by the words being said in the poem. It speaks about Arabic poems and so the main background was an arabic newspaper and I stuck on some verses from another poem by the same poet. These versus allude to (FINISH THIS). </li> 

<li> Costume 4: The last costume was just a green screen with videos played on it. The video synchronizes with the lyrics talking about a “homeland”. In this scene, I wanted the costume to, very early on, invite the user to think about this poem in the context of robots and I wanted to be explicit which is why I used the video of robots being constructed. I then shift it to displaying a video of a homeland for humans to hopefully draw complexities between the poem in the direction of both humans and robots. </li> 
</br> 
Set: 
<li> Set 1: The robot in this scene is very expressive and colorful and the scene itself is very expressive visually and therefore, I wanted the set to be on the simpler side and therefore, I only stuck sharpies on the wall to allude to being asks to draw something (as explained in the poem). I chose one colorful pen and one black pen to add to the complexities of the character.</li> 

<li> Set 2: This set mainly expresses the movement from the father being able to draw a blue sea to drawing a black sea to then just drawing black circles. Also, I had the pencil and a paper that says “Sea” in Arabic stuck on the wall to allude to the sea being not colorful and drawn with a pencil. </li> 

<li> Set3: This set is simply a bedroom with the relevant accessories there as spoken about in the poem. While the bedroom looks “human”, I added random wires to continue the theme and constantly remind the viewer that it’s not just any performance but a robotic one. </li> 

<li> Set 4: I wanted this scene to mainly focus on the video playing and so it doesn’t have anything exciting. </li>  

Movement: 

In this section, I’d just like to explain some movements that I don’t think were as obvious: </br>
In the first scene, when the robot wiggles briefly when I place the picture of a prison cell on him, this is a sign of disruption and rejection. </br>
In the third scene, when the robot moves towards the pillow and “scene” halfway through the scene then moves in a circle and transitions to scene 4, this is an indication of getting close to “home” or a sense of belonging by metaphorically getting close to the son figure in this scene but then moves away and is drawn back to the complexities the father is facing and this immediately takes him back to scene 4 which speaks about home. </br>
